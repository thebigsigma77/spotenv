4. **Download the Application**
   - Once you've selected a version, look for a file labeled like `spotenv.zip` or `spotenv.tar.gz`. Click on it to start the download. 
   - Be patient while the file downloads. The time may vary based on your internet speed.

5. **Extract the Files**
   - After completing the download, locate the file in your downloads folder. 
   - If you downloaded a `.zip` file, right-click and select ‚ÄúExtract All‚Äù or ‚ÄúExtract Here‚Äù. For a `.tar.gz` file, you may need a tool like WinRAR or a built-in extraction tool on macOS or Linux.
   - This will create a folder named `spotenv`.

6. **Open the Command Line**
   - Next, open your command line interface:
     - **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit `Enter`.
     - **macOS:** Open `Terminal` from your Applications folder.

     - On Windows: `cd [path-to-your-folder]`
     - On macOS/Linux: `cd [path/to/your/folder]`
   - Replace `[path-to-your-folder]` with the actual path of the Spotenv folder.

8. **Run Spotenv**
   - Now you can run Spotenv by typing:
     ```
     node spotenv.js
     ```
   - Ensure you have installed Node.js first; you can check if it's installed by running `node -v` in your command line.

9. **Scan Your Project**
   - Spotenv will prompt you to provide the path to your project. Enter the path and hit `Enter`.
   - Spotenv will scan your files for environment variables and create a `.env.example` file containing the keys it finds in your project.
